Prism Versioning
Copyright 2014 Jeffrey Armstrong <jeff@rainbow-100.com>

Introduction
============

Prism is a simple versioning system designed to work properly under MS-DOS
and provide git-like capabilities on a local disk.  It certainly won't be
nearly as functional, though.

Requirements
============

Other than the C standard library, Prism only requires zLib to be present.
This library can be easily compiled for MS-DOS, so don't panic.
